# To do

* Volume control: try DAC instead of PWM
* Experiment with SysEx messages to gain more control
* Ability to enter standalone mode without powering down: hold tuner button for 10s?
* Clean up code
* Tuner button: sometimes not registered properly by Zoom
* Takes long before Zoom accepts program changes at startup. Why?
* Thorough error/stability checking
