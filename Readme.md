Build a Zoom B3/G3 controller, controlled with an Android device. 

There have been methods to gain more control by physically modifying the B3 or G3 (http://ashbass.com/AshBassGuitar/Zoom/index.html), my goal was to create a footcontroller that can simply be plugged in the USB port, with no further modifications.  
The footswitch controls the Zoom through the USB port and control port and can be used to change patches, simulate the expression pedal (**not working atm**), and go into the tuner/mute. 

There are currently two versions:
* Full version: https://github.com/Craven112/ZoomControl/wiki/Full-Version
* Standalone version https://github.com/Craven112/ZoomControl/wiki/Standalone-Version
 
Differences between the two: https://github.com/Craven112/ZoomControl/wiki/Standalone-vs-Full
